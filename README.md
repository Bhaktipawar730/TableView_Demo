# TableView_Demo

**TableView_Demo** is a simple iOS application built using Swift and UIKit. This project demonstrates the implementation of a `UITableView` to display dynamic data with both main and detailed text in each cell.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Data Display**: Populate a table view with data from two arrays to show both primary and secondary text.  
- **Data Source Protocol**: Implements the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol for managing and displaying data in the table view.  
- **Reusable Cells**: Utilizes reusable cells for better performance and memory management.  
- **Simple UI**: Provides a basic table view structure to display rows dynamically.  

## How It Works  
1. **Data Arrays**: Two arrays are used to store the main and detailed text for the table view rows.  
2. **Data Source Assignment**: The view controller is assigned as the data source for the table view.  
3. **Table View Methods**:  
   - The number of rows is determined by the count of the data array.  
   - Each cell is configured to display text from the respective arrays.
